# Managing User Accounts

> Requires the **EntityAdmin** scope.

## Inviting a Person to Create a User Account

This can be done when you [Add a New Person](/management-portal/admin-quickstart.md#adding-people), or from their profile page. The person must have a valid primary Email address.

When you click 'Invite', a new User Account is created with a randomly generated password. The username is the FIRST primary email address associated with the Person.
The new User will receive an email asking them to confirm their email address. At this point, they will need to use the 'Forgot Password' link on the login screen (entering the confirmed email address) to reset their password.

## Managing User Roles

In order to access information about People and Groups (according to the permissions defined by their group memberships), users must have the following roles enabled:
  â€¢ **EntityUser**
This is enabled by default when you create a new User Account, and can be disabled by navigating to the User's Profile page (PEOPLE->Person) and selecting the last tab (Account Information).

If you wish to make a new User an ADMINISTRATOR of an organisation, you need to follow these steps:

  1. Add the EntityAdmin role to the user (Profile Page -> Person ->Account information tab)
  2. Navigate to the Organisation using the GROUPS page or the Organisational Tree in the Sidebar.
  3. Ensure the User is an Administrator of that group.

## Revoking Access

User access can be revoked at any time by clicking 'REVOKE ACCESS' on their record on the **PEOPLE** page or navigating to their Account Information Tab.

> This has NO IMPACT on their identity within the system -- they will still appear as members of groups, and their documents will be preserved.
---
## Reinstating Access

Access for blocked Users can be reinstated at any time from the **PEOPLE** page or the User's Account Information tab.
